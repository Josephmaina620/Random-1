    <h2><center>RANDOM THOUGHTS...</center></h2>
    <p><center><fonts=14></fonts> You ever wondered why we shift from Monday to Tuesday and not <br>
    back to sunday? From 8am to 9am and not 7am? I mean why should everything <br>
    progress forward and not backwards...? They say it's 'cause of the globe's rotation... <br>
    But is it? Does that mean if the globe stoped rotating time would stop too? Does it <br>
    mean if the globe changed the diretion of rotation time would progress backwards...? <br>
    Like would we start growing young? and finally back to our moms womb? <br>
    Our moms to their moms... Back to the age of dinosours? Would the dead resurrect...? <br>
